# UPE Intern Projects F24

Home for the UPE Intern Projects for the Fall '24 intern class.

## Structure

This repo will contain everyone's projects, so projects should be in their own subfolders, e.g.

```
/ (root)
|-- toby
|    | -- index.html
|    | -- src
|    |    | -- toby_file_1.py
|    |    | -- toby_file_2.py
|-- you
|    | -- (your project files in here!)
```

# Contributing

To create a new project in this repo, follow these steps:
- *Fork* this repo to create your own copy.
- *Clone* your fork to your local machine.
- Locally:
  - Create a new folder in the repo, named after you (or your project).
  - Add a text file named `README.md` to your subfolder.
  - Put whatever info you want (for now) into that `README.md`!
    - e.g. `"This is the folder for Toby's intern project!"`
- *Add* your changes to `git` via `git add .`
- *Commit* your changes to `git` via `git commit -m "some message here..."`
- *Push* your changes to GitHub via `git push`
  - You'll probably have to log in to GitHub here
- You should now see the folder/files you created on GitHub!
- Open a *pull request* from your fork to the main repo.

To update your project:
- Make sure to *sync* your fork (on Github) and run `git pull` locally.
  - Especially important if you're collaborating!
- Make any changes you want to make locally.
- Add/commit/push them to your fork.
- Open a PR from your fork to the main repo.
