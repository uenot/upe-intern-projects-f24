Gregory Fan's Submission for UPE Project

I made a short game where you walk through an empty city, then through a forest, then a cliff. There IS a end to the walk if one wishes to.

To run the game, unzip the build under the correct OS, then run the executable or application file.

The source code provided is the main folder Unity reads, except the Library folder which was excluded due to size. My source art and code can be found under "Assets".

The full Unity-readable file can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/17UFzxMZVV-uV74LI2anNdPZ1L2p7wqan/view?usp=sharing

The game is made in Unity Game Engine and coded in C#.
Sounds are NOT made by me, taken from freesound.org.
Art assets and code are made by me.

The file of the game is a copy of the original folder read by Unity.
Playable versions are in the Builds folder.
There might be resolution issues when starting the game.

Very mild content warning: implied suicide.
